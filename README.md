This repo includes the following 4 files:

   - README.md - explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 


   - CodeBook.md - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.	 


   - run_analysis.R - the R script that contains all the codes for the data analysis tasks.

		      Extensive comments were added in the code to make it readily understandable. 


   - tidy_summary.txt - the file generated by running the run_analysis() function defined in the run_analysis.R

		      The data in this file has 180 rows and 69 columns. Each column has a descriptive name.
		
		      The 180 rows are the product of 30 * 6, for 30 subjects and 6 activities performed by each subject.
			
		      The 69 columns are 66 features of mean or standard deviation of measurements plus 3 key columns -
		      subjectID, activityID, and activityName - used for aggregation computation.
